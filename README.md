# WorktimeWatchdog 🐕
A true serverless webapp to record your worktimes and give you time notifications!

All wrapped into a [single HTML file](WorktimeWatchdog.html) that you can run from your from your desktop with your favorite browser.

*...Just hoping your favorite browser is not IE11 because then I have bad news for you...* 😉

Try out the [latest version using Github](https://jeromewagener.github.io/WorktimeWatchdog/WorktimeWatchdog.html) pages (*demo page not serverless for obvious reasons*😅)

Oh yeah, please use at your own risk!
